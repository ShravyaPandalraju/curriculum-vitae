Telogical turns Sweet 16, Andrew says, in the All hands huddle this morning. He goes over the history of the product line. 
How it started, how it turned out to be. Also, Ken & Gray, the company's cofounders, celebrate their 16 years anniversaries too.

Oh man! 16 years. That's something.

I spent the last 8 years at Telogical working with amazing people, cool technologies and learning all the way. My only job but i have never regretted staying on.

Yesterday, i took upon the daunting task of organizing all my notes. Over the years, while learning, i used paper as a medium to collect my thoughts and learning. And there'a lot of it. I had asked help on Facebook months ago and also promised to pay anyone who could help me out in organizing all my notes. But none came forward. Fortunately, yesterday, was the the day! The day dawned upon me.
I bought a lot of 0.15$ colored folders and started out sorting all those papers. It took a whole day, but i was super happy that it was done. All the notes are now organized neatly by topic. Yay!

The notes were still fresh in my head. And the morning meeting too. These two things triggered off a thought in my head. 

I told myself "Oh, it might be a great idea putting all the things i have done at Telogical in a repo".

That's it. I went ahead and created this repo. I will go ahead and fill stuff up as it comes to me.

Happy Birthday Telogical! Glad to know you, bud.

Love,

Sameeri
